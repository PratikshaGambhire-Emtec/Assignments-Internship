    <p>Augmented reality is basically combination of a real scene viewed by a user and a
        virtual scene generated by a computer that augments the scene with additional
        information.
        An AR system adds virtual computer-generated objects, audio and other sense
        enhancements to a real-world environment in real time.
        Purpose of Augmented reality is basically to enhance a personâ€Ÿs performance and
        perception of the world & ultimately creating a system such that a user cannot tell the
        difference between the real world and the virtual augmentation of it</p>

    <p>The Augmented Reality (AR) has existed for over five decades, but the growth and
        progress in the past few years has been exponentially increased and is getting more
        popular in recent years. For interior designers, being able to think in three dimensions
        and visualizing projects is of great importance. The purpose of this study is to analyze
        the effect of using AR in design process to find the optimum space arrangement under
        the following criteria: the perception of 3D and 2D space, the visualization and
        analysis of the given space, and the usability of AR on mobile devices.</p>

            <h3>Objectives</h3>
            <li> To provide an easy user interface so that user should able to interact with virtual furniture using
                 Augmented Reality in real time, and in a real environment.</li>
    
            <li> To eliminate the human efforts by physically visiting the furniture store which
                   could be a very time consuming activity.</li>
            <li> To develop android application for interior designing using Augmented Reality.</li>
